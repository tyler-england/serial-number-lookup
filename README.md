# serial-number-lookup
Dashboard I created to make finding information easier across product lines. I keep it open at the bottom corner of my screen all day, and I frequently use it to quickly find information.

On the left, a user can enter a serial number, order number, or [partial] customer name and receive all of the info related to that machine/order. On the right, a user can enter a [partial] name for either a person or a conference room and receive the phone number/extension for that contact. The two sections are separated by buttons which allow a deeper dive into the results of a particular inquiry. 

Some of the functions were not coded in VBA because the native Excel functionality performs more quickly. Due to this, there are hidden sheets where calculations are carried out.
